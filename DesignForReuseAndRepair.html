            <h1><em>Changing the electronic lifecycle</em></h1>
            <p>A growing issue that we face today is the disposal of e-waste. Due to the nature of electronic components, they have to be properly discarded. When broken or unwanted electronics are sent to landfill, dangerous chemicals such as mercury or lead can leak into the water supply, causing damage to both people and the environment. Furthermore, electronics often contain rare, non-renewable materials such as cobalt, copper, silver, gold, platinum and aluminium. As we begin to utilise renewable energy for transportation as power, a lot of these materials will be in high demand.</p>
            <p>In an ideal world, all e-waste would be properly recycled. Unfortunately, electronics manufacturers don’t prioritise recyclability when designing and producing products, instead being motivated by profit. As a result of this, most recycling processes are slow, inefficient and often dangerous. Most countries have “solved” this issue by exporting their e-waste to countries with poor labour and safety laws, where workers are exposed to high levels of dangerous contaminants, leading to irreversible health effects. These practices are unsustainable, and if they continue serious harm could be done to our ecosystem. Proper recycling could massively reduce our carbon emissions - for example, extracting valuable metals such as gold from discarded electronics produces 80% less carbon emissions than mining it from the ground. Furthermore, recycled materials are 2-10 times more efficient than materials recycled from virgin ore. Currently, electronic devices are not optimised for recyclability, and recovery rates for Cobalt (an important metal for producing batteries) are merely 30%, whereas the technology we currently possess could allow us to harvest as much as 95% so long as electronic products are designed recyclability in mind.</p>
            <p>A common practice in the electronics industry is planned obsolescence. This is where devices are produced to have a short lifespan, e.g. 2-3 years, so that customers then buy a brand-new device to replace it. A good example of this is how Apple slows down their phones as time goes on to the point where they are obsolete. Furthermore, products are often designed in a way that makes them difficult to repair. A lot of manufacturers will use proprietary parts that are not available for purchase, and opt to use glue rather than screws so that they cannot easily be repaired, encouraging the purchase of a new model if a product is broken.</p>
            <p>In order to reduce the strain on our ecosystem, and decrease the volume of rare materials we import from other countries, The Jedi Council recommends that we put laws in place to force manufacturers to make their products easily recyclable so that the production of future electronic devices will have a smaller carbon footprint. Additionally, we suggest that it should be compulsory that any electronic device can be repaired with simple tools, and that replacement parts should be readily available.</p>

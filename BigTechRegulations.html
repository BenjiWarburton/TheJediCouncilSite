            <h1><em>Regulating the technology industry</em></h1>
            <p>In the past few years, “Big Tech” such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon Netflix, and Google have grown significantly dominant and valuable. They have risen to become the most influential companies in the world over the last decade with little to no government inspection. The industry’s self-regulation and lack of government supervision have hindered innovations and technological breakthroughs. In addition, the combination has also left billions worldwide who rely on the products and services produced by these tech giants vulnerable. In order to combat this, we must place regulations on the tech industry.</p>
            <p>Initially, the presence of a government backed regulator for the tech industry would put tech companies on an even playing field. By introducing a regulator, clearly defined rules and laws could be put in place. These clearly defined rules would cut the cost of innovation while holding companies accountable for playing down the abuses of their inventions such as sharing user data and facilitating the spread of fake news.</p>
            <p>Next, since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, many individuals have been concerned about issues concerning privacy on the internet. As a result of the government taking a hands-off approach to this internet privacy issues, corporations have asserted over any data that they come across, as well as the rights to use or transfer it without any restrictions. This has led to the manipulation and exploitation of many through the collection of data and its manipulation. To prevent this from happening, every corporation that holds personal data would be required to get permission prior to every use or transfer.</p>
            <p>Finally, the lack of competition has prevented the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms. By making it easier for people to switch between different operating systems or between social media accounts without people losing their data and messages, companies would be more willing to focus on innovation to retain their customers or gain more customers. For example, if it is easier to switch between iOS and Android, Apple would become less complacent at churning out innovations to prevent their customers from moving to Android based phones. Another method that can be used to encourage competition is to force platforms to choose between operating marketplaces and participating in them. This will end anticompetitive behaviour towards suppliers, advertisers, and users. </p>
            <p>All in all, giant tech companies have reigned without the oversight of the government for far too long. This negligence has led to the mitigation of the abuses of the Big Tech’s inventions, halts in innovation, damages to competitions, and the exploitation of the masses through data collection and manipulation. Therefore, we must act swiftly with haste and gusto to curb these practices by means of establishing a government backed regulator, prohibiting corporations from accessing private data without permission, and easing up the process of switching from one operating system to another all while retaining all data and information.</p>

            <h1><em>Regulating the technology industry</em></h1>
            <p>In the past few years, “Big Tech” such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon Netflix, and Google have grown significantly dominant and valuable. They have risen to become the most influential companies in the world over the last decade with little to no government oversight. The industry’s self-regulation and lack of government oversight have hindered innovations and technological breakthroughs. In addition, the combination has also left billions worldwide who rely on the products and services produced by these tech giants vulnerable. In order to combat this, we must place regulations on the tech industry.</p>
            <p>Initially, the presence of a government backed regulator for the tech industry would put tech companies on an even playing field. By introducing a regulator, clearly defined rules and laws could be put in place. The regulator would also be able to hold companies accountable for playing down the abuses of their inventions such as sharing user data and facilitating the spread of fake news.</p>
            <p>Next, since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, many individuals have been concerned about issues concerning privacy on the internet. As a result of the government taking a largely hands off approach to this internet privacy issues, corporations have asserted over any data that they come across, as well as the rights to utilise without any restrictions. This has led to the manipulation and exploitation of many through the collection of data and its manipulation. To prevent this from happening, every corporation that holds personal data would be required to get permission prior to every use or transfer.</p>

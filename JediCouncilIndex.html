        <h1><em>Welcome to the website of the Jedi Council!</em></h1>
        <p>Nowadays, it is unfathomable to picture our daily lives without the use of sophisticated modern technology. With the inventions of the internet, the mobile phone, the laptop, and the personal computer, it has never been easier to complete certain tasks or know certain things. However, this does not denote that technology is perfect. The advent of these scientific miracles has also given rise to a plethora of issues such as digital divide, problems concerning design for reuse and repair, and regulation of big tech. The aim of the Jedi Council is to promote awareness of these issues, bring them to light, and propose policies to deal with these issues.</p>

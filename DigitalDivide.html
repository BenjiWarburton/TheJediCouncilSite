            <h1><em>Our Views on the Digital Divide</em></h1>
            <p>Digital skills and access are key to allowing people from all species’ to fully participate in an increasingly digitally dependent society. Tackling the digital divide will be crucial to addressing social and economic inequalities and levelling up both individual planets and galaxies.
When the pandemic hit in March 2020, only 50% of households earning between £6,000 to £10,000 had starship internet access, compared to 99% of households with an income over £40,000. This huge decide in fast internet access results in a multitude of disadvantages:

                <dt>1. Educational Barriers</dt>
                <br>
                    <dd>As post-secondary education increasingly becomes online-focussed, access to higher education for poorer planets will decrease if the digital divide is not closed. For planets such as Tatioone, where a large portion of the population do not have access to the galaxy wide web, it becomes more difficult to escape poverty. This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the poor are unable to gain a higher education and therefore struggle to afford fast internet access, resulting in a loop which affects generation after generation. We propose to install large scale 17g networks in lower income planets such as Tatooine that would involve a very low monthly cost to support upkeep. They would function identically to modern sim cards and allow 10gb of access a month for £3. These would be state issued and would therefore allow better internet access for those unable to afford current monthly data plans. At the same time we aim to install Wi-Fi ‘hubs’ in towns and villages. This would be internet café style and allow free use of the web for people who need it. The cost could be lowered by allowing companies such as Starbucks or Java the Hutt to sell. The rental of those shop spaces would help support the upkeep of these Wi-Fi hubs.</dd>

                <dt>2. Economic Barriers</dt>
                <br>
                    <dd>As organisations such as banking and tax move online, managing finance and joining new schemes to apply for government funding and galactic benefits becomes more and more difficult. We propose an opt-in strategy, whereby everything continues to be communicated by letter, and people are able to opt in to moving online.</dd>
